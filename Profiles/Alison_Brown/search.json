["Alison Brown . 2nd Simulation Engineer at Progressive Engineering Solutions Progressive Engineering Solutions Connecticut, New York United states . Contact info 500+ connections Message More About I have a masters degree in engineering and competent in a variety of techniques and technologies including modelling, simulators, virtualization tools. I have a high technical skill level and have extensive experience with multiple simulation tools including Abacus, Ansys, Pro Mechanica and can easily and quickly learn any new software. I create complex mathematical and scientific models to simulate structure, fluid flow and heat dynamics. I test and simulate demonstrations to determine outcomes in controlled environments, in support of Lynsay Erickson our mechanical engineer. I mostly do this in the pre-production or testing phase to gauge performance or conduct other evaluations before investing the cost of full-scale development. I am passionate about understanding how things work and how to improve upon them. I love running and have competed in both the London marathon and the New York marathon.
