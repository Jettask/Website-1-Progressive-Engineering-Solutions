Contact info 500+ connections Message More About Experienced Global Supply Chain Specialist with a demonstrated history of working in the logistics and supply chain industry. I have an excellent track record of driving the decision making on which process, and importantly which material, to be used for each part. I have an excellent relationship with my Mechanical Engineers and provide DFM Feedback to them, to help them drive the decision on which technology and material for each part for them to do their job to the maximum ability. In addition, I play a crucial role in developing and maintaining good relationships with vendors and distributors. I have an excellent track record when it comes to optimizing the production chain, including all the business processes that a product undergoes until it arrives with the customer. This includes the acquisition of raw materials, production processes, transport from suppliers and to customers. I was always good at chess, and really enjoy the strategic element. I have managed to teach my daughter chess and am proud that she has been entered into the reginal finals.
