["Telvin Deadman . 2nd Productization Engineer at Progressive Engineering Solutions Progressive Engineering Solutions Connecticut, New York United states . Contact info 500+ connections Message More About I have 18+ years of hands-on work experience in developing complex real-world problems and a successful track record of productization experience. I am skilled at structured problem-solving techniques and as such I act as the point of contact for part/project related issues. I am always keen to meet the project milestone and meet the assembly, test and reliability requirement of the parts produced. I work extremely well as the project manager of the product/part that I owns, preparing specs, engineering instruction, assembly reports that are required for product release and qualifications. Responsibility: • Defining the Build of Material (BOM) for all parts level products. • Ensure Engineering samples and qualification samples are on time and achieve 1st time successful product qualification release. • Ensure products meet yield / quality / reliability expectations. • Maintain a matrix of key performance indices and drive improvement through team-based continuous improvement activities / projects. • Leverage knowledge of experts across functions to successfully launch new technologies. • Identify projects, coordinate and evaluate controlled experiments. Know how to validate experimental data and make data driven decisions. I love team sports and referee for my local soccer school.
